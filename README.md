# Working From Home setup
A script that will auto launch all relative apps required for when I am working from home


## How this came to be
I started my python journey by learning how to automate stuff with python. My first solo project/idea was learning how to automate the process of opening and signin into all the apps i use for when I work from home. 
The main modules for this are 'puautogui' and 'Selenium'. These allow me to either simulate mouse and keyboard inputs or open up a browser instance and opearte using CSS elements. 
I can not say that this would work for anyone but myself as all of the pyautogui commands feature screen coordinates that are relevant only to my setup.

## Roadmap
There is some issues with the selenium selection of the script - this is due to using an older version and not the most up to date one - and thus causing a lot of the methods to have changed. At some stage fixing that to make the script run smoothly would be ideal

## Notes
Included is a batch file so I can run the script through the run meny by only entering "WFH" - this saves a lot of time comapred to running from VSCode
